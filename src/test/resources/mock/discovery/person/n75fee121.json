  "overview": "My research is focused on the: 1) investigation of the comparative molecular pathogenesis of zoonotic intracellular bacterial pathogens in natural animal models, particularly brucellosis, salmonellosis, and mycobacterial diseases; 2) development of vaccines and host gene expression-based diagnostics for zoonotic and select agent caused diseases, and especially 3) development of in silico host:pathogen interactome predictive models based upon bi-directional in vivo host (bovine/murine) and Brucella spp., Mycobacterium spp.and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium interactions. We developed an in silico computational infection biology model based on actuall temporal in vivo bovine model microarray-based transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the acute infectious process. We developed a systems biology analysis of both host and pathogen comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic datasets derived from our in vivo biological model. We computationally fused the datasets based on actual Salmonella, Brucella and Mycobacterium data and computationally predicted bovine host structural proteins to identify maximum likelihoods of host and pathogen protein:protein interactions as the basis for our preliminary in silico interactome model to predict mechanistic genes and linked perturbed cellular pathways.",
